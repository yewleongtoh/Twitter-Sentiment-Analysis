This project aims to build a disaster prediction model using Twitter data and sentiment analysis techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as either disaster-related or non-disaster-related based on their content and sentiments expressed. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to achieve this task. By accurately identifying disaster-related tweets, the model can play a crucial role in crisis management, emergency response, and public safety. The project's code and findings can serve as a foundation for further research and real-world applications in disaster prediction from social media.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Twitter Disaster Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pavansanagapati/knowledge-graph-nlp-tutorial-bert-spacy-nltk/data). This dataset contains a collection of tweets, each labeled as either "disaster" or "non-disaster"

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: nltk, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

## Results
After training the model, the final accuracy achieved for disaster prediction from tweets is 79.57%.
